# FuzzyFM
(fzf based Vifm alike TUI File Manager)

> The Idea was to mimick Vifm. Why because why not. Also vifm with lots of previews and image previews (with ueberzug) made it kinda slower so I decide to play with fzf in meantime and from it this little baby born. I didnt knew it was possible but fzf is much more than just fuzzy finder it does the job more than I expected.
  *well not completely though there are still lots of works to be done.*

> Things Done!
  - Working previews
  - ability to toggle previews
  - xdg-open and launching stuff works pretty good

> Things To Do.
  - To add custom keybindings like in vifm to jump in specific directories
  - Image previews
  - multiple panes may be.
  - ability to toggle vim keybinds (be default fzf provide vim keys with ctrl keybind)
  - custom keybinds for execute external commands like copy, paste, move and delete and rename files/directories.

**I think thats enough lets not widen our hopes too much.**

> Current keybinds
 - ctrl + l to Enter
 - ctrl + w to toggle previews
